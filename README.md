# odin-recipes

## Odin Recipes is a toy project that puts in use the learnings from Odin's Foundation course (the first few chapters).

Odin Recipes has a list of three recipes that the user can navigate to from it's home page.
Each of the three recipes get their own landing page that displays a short description, the
ingredients and the steps to cook.

This is not a portfolio piece. This is simply a practise project to brush up basic HTML knowledge.
