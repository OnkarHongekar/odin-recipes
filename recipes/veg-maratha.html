        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Veg Maratha is a flavorful vegetarian dish from Maharashtra, India. It features crispy vegetable koftas (dumplings) bathed in a rich and spicy gravy. The koftas are typically made with a combination of boiled potatoes, grated carrots, chopped cabbage, and fresh herbs, offering a textural contrast to the smooth and creamy gravy. The gravy itself is a vibrant blend of tomatoes, onions, spices like coriander and red chili powder, and sometimes includes a touch of cashew paste or coconut for added richness. Veg Maratha is a perfect main course, often served with rice or roti (flatbread).</p>
